                  <p>Some companies treat the environment as public relation issue. At RMS it is an operational issue. We strive to keep the environment in the forefront of everything we do; we invest in environmental protection – making real improvement in our people, our ships and the equipment aboard them, and in our operation.</p>
                  <p>Every employee of RMS , both ashore and afloat, has a basic responsibility to comply with all rules and regulations designed to protect the environment. Of even greater importance, RMS strives to take a preventative approach by identifying and addressing environmental issues and risks before they become of concern to Dole’s customers, the industry or our vessels.</p>
                  <p>The cornerstone of good quality and safety management is commitment from the top, but it is the commitment, attitude and motivation of individuals at all levels which determines the end result.</p>
                  <p>RMS has a zero tolerance towards water pollution and is committed to provide equipment, spare parts and shore side disposal as required.</p>

                            <p>An effective bridge organization will include procedures that:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Consider unforeseen events which may develop into a serious and difficult situation.</li>
                                <li>Require the skills, abilities, and effective communication of all bridge team members.</li>
                                <li>Eliminate the risk that an error on the part of one person may result in a disastrous situation.</li>
                                <li>Emphasize the necessity to maintain a good visual lookout and to carry out collision avoidance routines.</li>
                                <li>Encourage the use of all means of establishing the ship’s position so that in the case of one method becoming unreliable others are immediately available.</li>
                                <li>Make use of passage planning and navigational systems which allow continuous monitoring and detection of deviation from the track when in coastal waters.</li>
                                <li>Ensure that all instrument errors are known and correctly applied.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>These procedures can only be achieved by each member of the bridge team realizing that he has a vital part to play in the safe navigation of the ship and that safety depends upon all personnel playing their part to the utmost of their ability.</p>
                            <p>Each team member must appreciate that the safety of the ship should never depend upon the decision of ONE person only. All decisions and orders should be carefully checked. Junior team members must never hesitate to question a decision made by a senior member if they consider that decision is not in the best interests of the ship.</p>
                            <p>The watch Officer has responsibility for his watch but must rely upon the assistance of the lookout and or the helmsman. He must ensure that the orders are correctly followed. Calling the Master to the bridge will not automatically transfer the conn from the watch officer to the Master. Until such time as the Master declares that he has taken the conn, the watch officer must still carry out his duties as he was prior to the Masters arrival. Once the Master has taken the conn and event logged, then the watch officer moves into a supportive role.</p>
                            <p>The Master controls the movements and navigates the vessel in accordance with the rules of the road and recommended traffic schemes. The watch officer continues to report relevant information to the Master, ensuring that such information is acknowledged. He will fix the own vessel, advise the position and other information, record all required entries in the logbook, and perform other duties as required by the Master.</p>
                            <p>Navigation in confined waters carries extreme risks such as:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Grounding</li>
                                <li>Collision and contact with other ships, floating and fixed objects</li>
                                <li>Damage to the marine environment</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>These risks can be minimized if the Master operates proper BRM because it focuses on the use and co-operation of all the skills and resources available to the bridge team to achieve goals of:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Safety and efficiency</li>

                                <li>The task should be clearly defined</li>
                                <li>Navigation maneuvers must be monitored</li>

                                    <p>It has been adequately demonstrated that failure to prepare a detailed Passage Plan from Berth to Berth can have disastrous consequences. The Master is responsible for the development of the plan for the intended voyage, and continuous monitoring of the vessel’s progress and position during execution of the plan is of essential importance for safety of life at sea, safety and efficiency of navigation and protection of the marine environment.</p>
                                    <p>There are several factors that may impede the safe navigation of the vessel. These factors will need to be considered in the preparation of the plan and in the subsequent monitoring of the execution of the plan.</p>
                                    <p>Passage planning includes appraisal, i.e. gathering all information relevant to the contemplated voyage. Based on the fullest possible appraisal a detailed passage plan shall be prepared which shall cover the entire voyage from berth to berth, including those areas necessitating the presence of a pilot, execution of the plan, and monitoring of the progress of the vessel.</p>
                                    <p>The Master shall plan the voyage to avoid potentially severe weather and sea conditions. In cases where severe weather and sea conditions are unavoidable, master should be conscious of the need to reduce speed and / or alter courses at an early stage to minimize the forces imposed on the vessel, its cargo, and securing.</p>
                                    <p>Master to refer to publications (such as Ocean Passage, Pilot Books, Tide Tables, light lists, lists of radio signals, appropriate scale, accurate and up-dated charts, Notice to Mariners, Ship’s routing system, Routing Charts, Recommendations from weather routing, etc.) at his disposal.</p>

                                    <p>At all times (in open sea, in port approaches and while the vessels are alongside) UKC must be commensurate with conditions and where appropriate with Pilots advice. When planning passages and considering UKC the following elements should be taken into consideration:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>The predicted height of tide.</li>

                                        <li>Accuracy of Hydrographic data (Including CATZOC), a note as to reliability is often included on charts.</li>
                                        <li>Change of water density and the increase in draft due to freshwater allowance.</li>
                                        <li>The vessels size and handling characteristics and increase in draft due to heel.</li>
                                        <li>Wave response allowance and swells, which is the vertical displacement of the hull due to heave, roll and pitch movements (wave heights divided by 2 and deducted from water depth for UKC calculations).</li>
                                        <li>The reliability of draft observations and calculations, including estimates of hogging and sagging.</li>

                                    <p><strong>Coastal waters and within port limits</strong></p>
                                    <p>The depth contours of less than 20 meters shall be considered as coastal waters. In costal water and within port limits the UKC will be at least 10% of the current maximum static draft. * If Port/Local Coast Guard/Pilot recommended UKC is more than the above then vessels must comply with Port/local Coast Guard/Pilot recommended UKC.</p>
                                    <p><strong>UKC at Berth</strong></p>
                                    <p>The minimum UKC must be 1.5/100 to the breath of the vessel. But never less than 30 cm at any time (* Value should also be considering momentarily sinkage due to Listing moment.)</p>

                                    <p>When the weather permits the error of both the magnetic and gyrocompasses should be ascertained at least once during every watch. A comparison shall be made between Standard Steering and Gyro Compasses at the commencement of each watch whenever an alteration of course is made and frequently during the watch. The results of compass observations shall be entered in the Compass Observation Record Book.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Magnetic Compasses</strong></p>
                                    <p>Although the Company’s ships are fitted with Gyrocompasses, it is essential that the Magnetic compasses are maintained in an efficient condition.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Calibration & Compass Deviation Curves</strong></p>
                                    <p>It is RMS policy to have magnetic compasses calibrated by professional adjusters. This should normally take place after dry-docking. Should it not be possible to carry out the services on sailing from dry-docking port (because of departure during the dark hours or poor visibility, etc.), the compasses should be adjusted at the first port where conditions are suitable and service available. Should a Master consider magnetic compasses require adjustment at a time other than following a dry-docking (see below), he should advise RMS stating his reasons.</p>
                                    <p>The Deviation Curve is to be drawn up by the Master at least once each year, or when deviations recorded in the Compass Observation Record Book indicate they are far off the normal when compared with the previous curve. It should be noted that it is not abnormal for deviations to vary by up to two degrees over time from last “adjustment” of the compass depending on time elapsed, number of crossings between northern and southern hemispheres, or the condition of loading of the vessel. If deviations exceed 5 degrees from the last adjusted curve, a professional compass adjuster’s service may be necessary.</p>

                                                <p>In reduced visibility or suspected reduced visibility, the Master must consider the information available to him on radar before deciding on any appropriate action. In deciding on the appropriate action, however, the Master must use his discretion and judgment to the fullest, always bearing in mind the wording of the collision regulations. It should be borne in mind that icebergs, wooden ships, tugs and barges may not show up on radar screens as readily as do most types of ships, so that a clear screen does not necessarily mean a clear seaway.</p>

     <p> All the checklists and standing instructions in the world will not prevent accidents or emergencies, but a well-trained and disciplined crew is key to restricting the situation and preventing damage, loss of life or injury.</p><br>
<p style="color: #4a4a4a; font-weight: normal;">The Master is responsible for ensuring that checklists and standing instructions are understood and complied with. He is also responsible for conducting regular drills such as FIRE, ABANDON SHIPS, SOPEP (see manual), CONTINGENCY PROCEDURES (see QSMS Checklists/Standing Instructions manual) and MAN OVERBOARD. </p>
<p style="color: #4a4a4a; font-weight: normal;">These drills are to be closely monitored and reviewed, and comments are to be filed in the master’s Review for forwarding to RMS Management.
Minimum one SOPEP/Contingency drill to be carried out monthly. See Appendix 6 for Onboard Training Program.</p>
   <p>8.1.2 Preparing for an Emergency – Ashore</p>
<p>An EMERGENCY CRISIS TEAM has been established to deal with shipboard emergencies endangering the crew, the vessel and/or the environment, and to alert and mobilize the resources that can advise and assist the Master and his crew. </p><br>
<p style="color: #4a4a4a; font-weight: normal;">To respond quickly and decisively to an emergency is an essential element of the safety management system.
<p style="color: #4a4a4a; font-weight: normal;">The seriousness of an emergency is something that only the Master can decide. His judgment and his initial report to his DVM will determine whether the Emergency Crisis Team has to be assembled.</p>

        <p>
The Master is responsible for the implementation of the Safety Management System on board, and to ensure that its objectives are met; periodical reviews are to be conducted on board at intervals of no more than 6 months.
The Master’s Reviews should focus on effectiveness of the Safety Management System (QSMS) and include suggestions for its improvement. In order to obtain an effective evaluation at all levels of operation on board, the Master may delegate responsibilities for the reviews to his department heads. Participation of all the crew in the review process is of paramount importance.</p>
     <p>Master’s Reviews should include:
      <ul>
    <li style="color: #4a4a4a; font-weight: normal;">• Findings of Audits, Class, Port State and Flag inspections.</li>
    <li style="color: #4a4a4a; font-weight: normal;">• Documented analysis of accident and incidents</li>
    <li style="color: #4a4a4a; font-weight: normal;">• Feedback on the effectiveness of the Safety Management System, with a focus on any area of concern which is a potential hazard.</li>
    <li style="color: #4a4a4a; font-weight: normal;">• Recommendations for the improvement of the system, and for amendments to the QSMS manual.</li>
    <li style="color: #4a4a4a; font-weight: normal;">• Results of the feedback from the Office of Earlier Reviews.</li>
    <li style="color: #4a4a4a; font-weight: normal;">• Annual Reviews of SOPEP, Work & Rest Hour Records, PMS and SSA/SSP at intervals specified in the form.</li>
  </ul><br>
    <p>Master’s Reviews are to be prepared in the format provided twice a year, in March and September, and sent to the QSMS Analyst at RMS, San José who will acknowledge receipt and distribute them within the department. The comments of anyone within the department will be reviewed at routine Management Meetings.</p>
<p>The DVMs are responsible for responding to the Master’s Review and relaying the conclusions and/or recommendations agreed to at the Management Meeting.
Amendments to the QSMS manuals will be prepared by the DVM responsible for the QSMS process or DPA and will be circulated by the QSMS Analyst..</p>
     
<p>12.2.1 Filing of Master’s Review.<br>
Master’s review to be filed onboard long with DVM comments and closing date from RMS.
The Master’s Review shall not be considered closed before this has been done..</p>
